                    <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
                    <p>Zach: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Favorite color grey</li>
                            <li>Quiet, calm, and steady are his most visible qualities</li>
                            <li>Tech wiz</li>
                            <li>Always willing to try anything once (maybe even twice!)</li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p>Lynde:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Favorite color is pink</li>
                            <li>Loud, bubbly, and energetic are her most visible qualities</li>
                            <li>She is a social butterfly and loves to entertain and cook for friends</li>
                            <li>Like Zach, also willing to try anything once</li>
                        </ul></p>
                    <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
                    <p>Zach and Lynde both moved to Madison around the same time.  Lynde moved for a new adventure and because she knew Nate and Amanda Hobert, who moved to plant The Vine Church.  Zach was still living in Platteville, WI finishing his degree in electrical engineering but came to Madison to do a nine-month internship with Extreme Engineering Solutions.  They met while attending the Vine, where they belonged to the same city group (small group/Bible study).  Zach and Lynde at that point were friends, but only that.  Zach went back to Platteville to finish his degree and slipped from Lynde’s radar (for now).  One year later, Zach was offered a full time job at Extreme and moved back to Madison; he slipped by unnoticed for a few months, but soon Lynde realized he was back in town and his social calendar became much more full!  Zach and Lynde remained friends for a couple more years.  Time came to plant the next church, <a target="_blank" href="//redeemercitychurch.org">Redeemer City</a>.  Zach and Lynde both agreed to be a part of the core/startup team.  Soon they were spending 3-4 days a week together because of frisbee and church related activities.  Their friendship grew as they realized they both enjoyed spending time outdoors, cooking, and then of course eating!  Eventually, Zach realized he wanted to be more than just friends with Lynde, so he asked her out.  Zach and Lynde dated for about 3.667 months and then he asked her to be his forever.</p>
                    <h3>Our Future</h3>
                    <p>We are striving (though not perfectly) to keep Christ at the center of our relationship.  We recognize that we need to put our hope, significance, and joy in Christ and what he has done for us on the Cross.  We ask for prayer as we continue to learn what it looks like to serve God, serve each other, and serve others before serving ourselves.  Pray that we would continue to spend time in God’s Word for wisdom and guidance; that we wouldn’t look to each other for worth and happiness but to the One who has given us all we need, want, and could ever hope for.  May we continue to do all things for His glory and may we be refined through this relationship and marriage.  Please pray that we would be even a small reflection of Christ’s love for the Church, and that our marriage would be one that encourages others to want to know more about who God is! </p>

                    <h2>Registry</h2>
                    <p>We are doing something a little different with our registry.  Zach and I have the privilege to say we have everything that we need, and just about everything we want.  Through our past four years of being a part of the Vine Church and Redeemer City Church, God has changed our hearts.  We want more for His glory than ours, and hope to be a blessing to our church family.  We use the word family because they are. As the church family we eat together, pray together, worship, and share our joys and sorrows together.  We, by God’s grace, have been transformed by the good news of the Gospel. Therefore we encourage you to read the verses below, and to please consider our suggestion.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</p>
                    <footer>1 John 3:16-18 (ESV)</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.  And all who believed were together and had all things in common.  And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.  And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p>
                    <footer>Acts 2:42-47 (ESV)</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>We have one, in our Redeemer City family, who does not have all that he needs.  Our dear friend, Kyle and his family (Anna, Alivia, and Othello) are fighting a battle with cancer.  Kyle has a very rare form of kidney cancer which means the vast majority of his treatments have been/are experimental (read: not covered by insurance).</p>
                    <p>If you were considering giving us a gift, we would like to encourage you to please support Kyle and his family with a donation of support instead.  More information about Kyle, his story, and how to donate can be found below or you can contact Zach with questions or gifts.</p>
